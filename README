sfCryptoCaptcha Plugin
======================


This plugin generates a higly configurable captcha to block spam and robots.
The script is based on the [Cryptographp library](http://www.captcha.fr/ "Cryptographp") but
is actually a complete rewrite in PHP 5 and in OOP of the sfCryptographpPlugin
that was available for symfony 1.0 on the trac wiki.

Installation
------------

The plugin is easy to install, by using SVN or PEAR:


### Install using PEAR

    $ symfony plugin:install sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin

If this doesn't work, try the help option for plugin installation

    $ symfony help plugin:install


### Install using SVN

    $ mkdir plugins/sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin
    $ cd plugins/sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin
    plugins/sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin$ svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/plugins/sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin .
    $ cd ../..

Activate the plugin in you applications `settings.yml` file:

    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules:        [default, sfCryptoCaptcha]

Then plublish the assets and clear the cache:

     $ symfony plugin:publish-assets
     $ symfony cc


### Configure plugin

This plugin can be easily configured with the `app.yml` file. All the options
are detailed in the comments of the original configuration file.

Some precisions thought:

  * img_dir : the image directory is searched under the web/ directory of the project.
  * char_random_color_lvl : the color of the characters if they are randomly selected. It selectes between very dark and very light colors (1 = very dark, 2 = dark, 3 = bright, 4  very bright)
  * char_fonts_dir : same for the char fonts directory, it is searched under the web/ directory of the project.
  * chars_used : the characters specified here are used only if easy_captcha is set to false.
  * easy_captcha_bool : not very important, it defines if the easy captcha starts with a vowel or consonnant.
  * format : there are 3 formats available: png, jpeg and gif
  * flood_timer : the timer prevents from refreshing too often. Don't set a too high value for it may display an [Error - refreshing too fast] if you submit a form with errors before the minimum waiting time.
  * max_refresh : this option is reset to 0 when a good captcha is entered (anywhere on your project site)

>**Note**
>When configuring the plugin, use the application `app.yml` file to override the setting you want to change. Do not use the the plugin `app.yml` file


## Using the plugin

Two helper functions are to be used in your template 

    [php]
    // in the head of your template, call the helper
    use_helper('sfCryptoCaptcha');
    
    //the helper functions
    captcha_image();
    captcha_reload_button();
    
    // in a table form it looks like this
    <tr>
      <th><?php echo $form['captcha']->renderLabel(); ?></th>
      <td>
        <?php echo $form['captcha']->renderError(); ?>
        <?php echo $form['captcha']->render(); ?>
      </td>
      <td><?php echo captcha_image(); echo captcha_reload_button(); ?></td>
    </tr>

The first helper displays the captcha image, the second one is the reload button (if the user can't read the picture and want to use another one).

>**Note**
>If there is no image displayed, it may be because you are using a :format in your url (adding .html for example) [see the troubleshooting section below]


## Validation

To validate the entered captcha code in a form, use the sfValidatorSfCryptoCaptcha validator like so:

    [php]
    //this is in your somePurposeForm.class.php file
    $this->setWidgets(array(
           // .. other fields ..
           'captcha'       => new sfWidgetFormInput(),
           // .. other fields ..
    ));
    $this->widgetSchema->setLabels(array(
           // .. other fields ..
           'captcha'       => 'Please copy the security code.',
           // .. other fields ..
    ));
    $this->setValidators(array(
           // .. other fields ..
           'captcha' => new sfValidatorSeCaptcha(array('required' => true, 'trim' => true),
                                                 array('wrong_captcha' => 'The code you copied is not valid.',
                                                 'required' => 'You did not copy any code. Please copy the code.')),
           // .. other fields ..
    ));
    $this->errorSchema = new sfValidatorErrorSchema($this->validatorSchema);


## Dependencies

There are no dependecies other than PHP >= 5.0.0

## Versions

  * sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin_v0.0.3 => New PHP5 and OOP version of the sfCryptographp_v1.0.0 plugin and of the Cryptographp library (mixed and updated). Only the concepts and functionnalities have been kept from the original library.
  * sfCryptographpPlugin_v1.0.0 => First version of the Cryptographp library in a symfony plugin. It was available for symfony 1.0 on the trac wiki

## Todo List

These are the things that need to be implemented/fixed:

 * The fonts directory is under the web directory so if you know the font name, you can download it (not very good)
 * The functionality to reuse a captcha (by saving it in clear in the user session) has been removed from the original library, it could be nice to code it back in and add an option to activate that feature - still, this is a less secure method than making a new captcha everytime.

## Troubleshooting

If there is no image or no refresh button, check the following:

  * try displaying a single captcha image by going to the URL /captcha in your symfony site
    * if there is an image here, then the helper must be doing something wrong (or you forgot to add the helper functions in your template)
    * if you get errors, make sure that:
      * you have executed the `plugin:publish-assets` command (under Windows, you may have to manually copy the sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin/web to the web/ directory)
      * the fonts directory is properly configured (in the `app.yml` file)
      * the web/sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin/fonts direcotry and sub-directories have the proper permissions
      * all the permissions of the plugin are correct
      * if there is still no image, check that the image is correctly destroyed in the sfCryptoCaptcha class with `imagedestroy($this->image);` line 220
        * same for the noise, if there is no noise, check that the image-brush is destroyed with `$this->clearBrush();` line 198
  * back in your template, make sure that:
    * the final paths are correct (/captcha for the image and /sfCryptoCaptchaPlugin/images/refresh.png for the refresh image)
    * there is no conflict in the url (/captcha not used by some other plugin or module of the same name)
    * there is no special :format applied in the URL (the helper does not (yet) handle extensions/formats[like .html, .php etc.])
  * after checking all this, if it still doesn't work, you'll have to check everything directly in the source of the plugin. If you notice a glitch or a bug, please contact-me[henearkrxern [at] hotmail.fr] and I'll update the script. Thanks :)
